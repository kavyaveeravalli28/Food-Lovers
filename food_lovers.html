                <h2>Types Of Foods:</h2>
                    <p>*Vegetables<br/>*Fruits<br>*Junks<br/>*Drinks.....etc</p>

                    <p><b>What is the importance of food?</b>
                       <br/> Food is the third most important thing for living beings to provide energy and development, maintain life, or stimulate growth after air and water. It is one of the most complicated sets of chemicals. Food plays an important role in the promotion of health and disease prevention.</p>
                    <h2>Food As Information</h2>
                       <p>Examples of the Roles Nutrients Play
                        Here are some examples of nutrients essential for specific body functions. These nutrients provide "information" so the body can complete the necessary processes. (Note: This is a simplification for illustrative purposes. There are no doubt many more substances involved in all of these processes, including trace minerals and co-factors.)
                        
                        Immune function: vitamin A, vitamin E, zinc, folic acid, vitamin B-6, riboflavin, magnesium, selenium, vitamin C
                        
                        Nerve impulses: sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, vitamin B6, folic acid, B-12, copper, vitamin C
                        
                        Tissue repair and formation: vitamin A, vitamin E, copper, riboflavin, magnesium, vitamin B6, vitamin C
                        
                        Metabolism: potassium, thiamin, niacin, vitamin B6, magnesium, riboflavin, folic acid, vitamin C
                        
                        Note that magnesium is needed for all of the functions listed above. Let's take a closer look at magnesium as "information."
                        
                        What is magnesium?
                        Magnesium is a mineral found in whole grain, wheat germ, nuts, and seeds (especially pumpkin seeds), soybeans, tofu, chocolate, dark-green vegetables, legumes, yogurt, and other dairy products. However, the amount of magnesium in any magnesium-rich food is influenced by the soil content in which the food was grown. In many commercial farms, magnesium has been depleted from the soil.

                       <b>Functions of magnesium:</b>
                        Needed for healthy bones
                        Involved in nerve transmission
                        Initiates muscle release
                        Activates energy synthesis
                        Promotes healthy blood vessels
                        Inhibits platelet aggregation
                        Lowers&nbsp;blood pressure
                        Increases HDL cholesterol
                        Involved in temperature regulation
                        Helps control blood sugar
                        Promotes wound healing
                        Enhances immune function
                        If a person did not get enough magnesium over a period of time, these functions would decline. The magnesium insufficiency might manifest as the following:
                        
                        Blood pressure issues, such as hypertension
                        Spasming of a muscle, such as an arrhythmia in the heart, a muscle cramp in a leg, or a spastic colon
                        Eating magnesium-rich foods or supplementing with magnesium would provide the information needed to restore function and reduce risk.</p>

                        Because of its centrality to human life, problems related to access, quality and production of food effect every aspect of human life.<br/>

                        <b>
                           <br/> Nutrition and dietary problems<br/>
                        </b>
                        Between the extremes of optimal health and death from starvation or malnutrition, there is an array of disease states that can be caused or alleviated by changes in diet. Deficiencies, excesses, and imbalances in diet can produce negative impacts on health, which may lead to various health problems such as scurvy, obesity, or osteoporosis, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases as well as psychological and behavioral problems. The science of nutrition attempts to understand how and why specific dietary aspects influence health.

Nutrients in food are grouped into several categories. Macronutrients are fat, protein, and carbohydrates. Micronutrients are the minerals and vitamins. Additionally, food contains water and dietary fiber.

As previously discussed, the body is designed by natural selection to enjoy sweet and fattening foods for evolutionary diets, ideal for hunters and gatherers. Thus, sweet and fattening foods in nature are typically rare and are very pleasurable to eat. In modern times, with advanced technology, enjoyable foods are easily available to consumers. Unfortunately, this promotes obesity in adults and children alike.<br/>

<b>Hunger and starvation<br/></b>
Food deprivation leads to malnutrition and ultimately starvation. This is often connected with famine, which involves the absence of food in entire communities. This can have a devastating and widespread effect on human health and mortality. Rationing is sometimes used to distribute food in times of shortage, most notably during times of war.
Starvation is a significant international problem. Approximately 815 million people are undernourished, and over 16,000 children die per day from hunger-related causes.Food deprivation is regarded as a deficit need in Maslow's hierarchy of needs and is measured using famine scales.
                  <br/><br/> <b>Food waste<br/></b>
    Food loss and waste is food that is not eaten. The causes of food waste or loss are numerous and occur throughout the food system, during production, processing, distribution, retail and food service sales, and consumption. Overall, about one-third of the world's food is thrown away. A 2021 metaanalysis that did not include food lost during production, by the United Nations Environment Programme found that food waste was a challenge in all countries at all levels of economic development. The analysis estimated that global food waste was 931 million tonnes of food waste (about 121 kg per capita) across three sectors: 61 per cent from households, 26 per cent from food service and 13 per cent from retail.

Food loss and waste is a major part of the impact of agriculture on climate change (it amounts to 3.3 billion tons of CO2e emissions annually) and other environmental issues, such as land use, water use and loss of biodiversity. Prevention of food waste is the highest priority, and when prevention is not possible, the food waste hierarchy ranks the food waste treatment options from preferred to least preferred based on their negative environmental impacts. Reuse pathways of surplus food intended for human consumption, such as food donation, is the next best strategy after prevention, followed by animal feed, recycling of nutrients and energy followed by the least preferred option, landfill, which is a major source of the greenhouse gas methane.Other considerations include unreclaimed phosphorus in food waste leading to further phosphate mining. Moreover, reducing food waste in all parts of the food system is an important part of reducing the environmental impact of agriculture, by reducing the total amount of water, land, and other resources used.

The UN's Sustainable Development Goal Target 12.3 seeks to "halve global per capita food waste at the retail and consumer levels and reduce food losses along production and supply chains, including post-harvest losses" by 2030.Climate change mitigation strategies prominently feature reducing food waste.
